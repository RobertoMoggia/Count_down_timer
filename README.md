# Count down timer
This repository contains a simple countdown timer developed as final project of the function module of the Programming Basics course (by TomorrowDevs).
For this project I decided to use a multithread approach.

## Main features
**Display Current Time**   
The program can display the current time and date based on the system clock.

**Time Zone Conversion**  
The user can to input a specific time zone, and then display the current time in that time zone.

**Countdown Timer**   
The user can set a countdown timer for a specific amount of time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) 
and display the remaining time. Stopwatch feature is provided in order to stat, stop and reset the timer.

**World Clock Display**   
The user add and display multiple clocks for different time zones simultaneously.
